            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The internet has made massive progress since the 1990s. The amount of traffic that crosses the Internet
                now is 22 million times more than what was generated in 1992. Although the fiber optic cables replaced
                the century-old copper cables to transmit trillions of bits per second, the end user at a local area is
                still hungry for more bandwidth to run new emerging applications. This put both ISPs and the mobile
                network operators under challenges: Are they ready for the Mammoth Internet? Will ISPs be able to offer
                the capacity to meet the growing demand? Is their infrastructure capable of serving the future
                disruptive services such as 4K/8K technology, VR/AR, autonomous vehicles, etc? The literature lacks a
                comprehensive study of bandwidth requirements for the end user in both fixed-access and mobile Internet.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The advancement of telecom technologies in recent years has opened the door for development of next
                generation digital services and applications. However, they have also led to a huge surge in data
                traffic that has evolved from Kilobytes to Exabytes over the years. These data-driven services have
                different Internet bandwidth (BW) requirements. Therefore, the projection of the future BW requirements
                for consumers of these services is of direct interest to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and cellular
                networks operators. Overlooking this problem poses a real risk to their networks, and consequently may
                impact their customers.

                The coming few years will be critical for cellular operators and ISPs to make their future networks
                adaptable to include a multitude of cellular-enabled devices and services. The contributions of this
                paper are as follows. <br>
                <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Identify most disruptive bandwidth drivers for both fixed-access Internet and cellular-based
                    Internet.
                </li>
                <li class="BoldItalic">
                    Provide a case study of flagship smartphones and their bandwidth requirements for streaming video
                    contents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Develop forecasting models for both fixed-access Internet, and cellular-based mobile Internet; and
                    then project the future bandwidth requirements for the users of both networks by year 2021.

                <li class="BoldItalic">
                    Conduct multiple experiments to show the validity of our models, and the impact of each bandwidth
                    driver on the future of bandwidth requirements.

                This paper provides an insightful projection of the future bandwidth of both fixed-access and mobile
                Internet. For the two approaches, fixed-access and mobile Internet, we identify the bandwidth drivers
                and compare them in terms of their impact on the future bandwidth demand. We design our models of
                fixed-access/mobile Internet to cover a wide variety of household/connection-sharing types and as well
                as usersâ€™ Internet usage behavior. Our findings in fixed-access Internet show that 4K and VR/AR
                technology will shape the future of residential bandwidth. On the other hand, while IoT is growing on an
                everyday basis with many potential innovative technologies, it will not alter the bandwidth consumption
                pattern of typical households. Our model predicts a jump in residential bit rate demand especially for
                houses which adopt more new technology such as VR/AR and 4K video streaming. We project that more than
                35% of households will demand bit rate speed of more than 100 Mbps, and 10% will require more than 300
                Mbps.<br>
